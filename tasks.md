# Tasks: New Feature Definition

**Input**: Project Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
**Prerequisites**: None (initial feature definition)

**Tests**: Not applicable for definition tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase to guide the initial feature definition process.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Feature Initialization)

**Purpose**: Initial project setup and defining the feature's scope.

- [ ] T001 Define the new feature's name and create feature directory `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/`
- [ ] T002 Create initial `spec.md` in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md` for the new feature
- [ ] T003 Create initial `plan.md` in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/plan.md` for the new feature

## Phase 2: Foundational (Constitutional Alignment)

**Purpose**: Ensuring the new feature adheres to the project's constitution from the outset by defining its core aspects.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: The following tasks must be completed to ensure constitutional alignment before detailed design.

- [ ] T004 Define user stories for Basic Level (MVP) functionality in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md` (Constitution Principle II)
- [ ] T005 Outline the technical context and stack for the Basic Level in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/plan.md` (Constitution Principle V)
- [ ] T006 Define user stories for Intermediate Level functionality in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md` (Constitution Principle III)
- [ ] T007 Outline the technical context for the Intermediate Level in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/plan.md` (Constitution Principle V)
- [ ] T008 Define user stories for Advanced Level functionality in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md` (Constitution Principle IV)
- [ ] T009 Outline the technical context for the Advanced Level in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/plan.md` (Constitution Principle V)
- [ ] T010 Document explicit error paths and constraints for the feature in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md`
- [ ] T011 Document non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability) in `specs/new-feature-from-constitution/spec.md` (Constitution Principle VI)

**Checkpoint**: Core feature definition and constitutional alignment established.

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Review and refine the initial feature definition.

- [ ] TXXX Review the feature `spec.md` for clarity and completeness
- [ ] TXXX Review the feature `plan.md` for architectural soundness and constitutional adherence
- [ ] TXXX [P] Validate alignment with "Incremental Feature Progression" (Constitution Principle I)
- [ ] TXXX [P] Validate alignment with "User Experience Focus" (Constitution Principle VI)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS detailed design
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired feature definition tasks being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- Tasks T004-T011 can be considered somewhat parallel if different aspects of the constitution are addressed independently, but they are logically sequential in building up the feature definition.
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Definition

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup → Initial feature directories and template files created.
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational → Core feature aspects defined, aligned with constitution.
3. Complete Phase N: Polish → Feature definition reviewed and refined.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- No [Story] labels yet, as user stories are being defined in this phase.
- This tasks.md guides the *definition* of a new feature, not its implementation.
- Future tasks.md (generated by `/sp.tasks` on a fully defined feature) will have user story labels and implementation details.
